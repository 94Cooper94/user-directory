## Description :book:
  You're tired of trudging through pages upon pages of directory information when all you need is a simple email, or information sorted in a specific pattern. User-directory is here to help! Feel free to search or sort critical information and find results faster than the speed of paint drying. We've utilized a custom state-of-the-art dummy API that generates completely fictional data for your browsing and testing purposes.
